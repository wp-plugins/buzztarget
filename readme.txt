Commercial Real Estate Listing integration with BuzzTarget.  Publish your BuzzTarget listings to your Private WordPress powered site.

== Description ==

BuzzTarget is a 3-in-1 platform for commercial real estate professionals that allows free unlimited listings, 
targeted email marketing distribution to our community of industry professionals, and the ability to target 
and manage your own private contacts lists.

BuzzTarget is perfect for commercial real estate professionals who want to increase and improve their marketing efforts; reach a targeted audience; 
announce or receive new listings information; call for or receive offers on listings; search for investment opportunities; 
find financing or locate space; get deals done.

The BuzzTarget plugin allows a broker to retrieve his/her listings from BuzzTarget and display it on his/her WordPress powered site.  The plugin eliminates 
duplicate entry and unnecessary maintenance of listings on multiple sites.  With this plugin, listings are pulled on a scheduled basis (or on demand).  Listing and
